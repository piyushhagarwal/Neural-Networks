# Neural Networks

### This repository will follow the book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen. The book can be found [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

The repository will contain brief summaries of each chapter, as well as the code that is presented in the book. The code will be written in Python, and will be written in a way that is easy to understand.
